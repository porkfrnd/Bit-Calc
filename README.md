# Bit Calculator
### By bonky katto

## What does it do?

It basically takes two integers from user and use binary operations on those data.

### It can do the following

* **Addition**
* **Substraction**
* **Multiplication**
* **Exponentation**
* **Division**

## How does it work?

It works by doing simple binary operation by using the following Bitwise operators

* **Bitwise XOR**
* **Bitwise AND**
* **Bitwise NOT**

## How to use?
First u will need to install this repository
```
git install https://github.com/porkfrnd/Bit-Calc/
```

and then create a file there and call

> from bit_calc import *

and then use it as shown in the test.py file inside the bit_calc folder

### ***Note***

This application does have some downsides like subtraction cannot be done with the smaller number upfront like shown below
> subtract(3,6)

Rather it should be done with the bigger number upfront like shown below
> subtract(6,3)
